Hi There!

I am a Developer with an eye to building services that scale. I am working on serverless these days. Also, I feel content when I bring beautiful and thoughtful design to live applications. I love to automate stuff and use that time to do something else like watching funny animal videos.

- I like to write blogs:  https://lekshmic.medium.com/ https://dev.to/lek890 
- And to save something for later: Helpful gists: https://gist.github.com/lek890
- And to keep something packed here: NPM packages: https://www.npmjs.com/~lek890

Thanks for stopping by. If you like to contact me, please write to me in Linkedin. 

Have a nice day!
