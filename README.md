Hi There!

I am a Developer with an eye to building services that scale. I feel content when I bring beautiful and thoughtful design to 
life. I am experimenting serverless these days. I love to automate stuff and use that time to do something else like watching funny animal videos.

- I like to write blogs: https://dev.to/lek890,
- And to save something for later: Helpful gists: https://gist.github.com/lek890,
- And to keep something packed here: NPM packages: https://www.npmjs.com/~lek890,
- And to draw stick figures: Insta: https://www.instagram.com/eine_perspective/

Have a nice day!
